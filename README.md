## What is Medo

Have you ever been at a bar, and been talking about music or movies with a group of people?  Normally, conversations flow around the "Hey, have you seen this movie?!"  or "Did you ever hear of this band"? 

Another dilema we often find ourselves in is our Constant Comfort Media picks.  How many times have you watched the Office now?  7 times?  What about that Motley Crew record?  Probably in the hundreds by now...

This is where MEDO comes in.

A streamlined user-focused WEBAPP (mobile coming soon) to create a Media focused to-do list!


When you get those recommendations at a bar/social gather, all you have to do is add them to your MeDo list! Your entries will provide small tidbits of info and ultimately help you determine if this media suites your fancy!  

You can put finally hang up the Office in here, just incase somehow you forgot that you've already watched every episode 20 times...
